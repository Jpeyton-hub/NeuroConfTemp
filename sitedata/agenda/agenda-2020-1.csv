1,Abstraction and inference in the prefrontal hippocampal circuitry,"The cellular representations and computations that allow rodents to navigate in space have been described with beautiful precision. In this talk, I will show that some of these same computations can be found in humans doing tasks that appear very different from spatial navigation. I will describe some theory that allows us to think about spatial and non-spatial problems in the same framework, and I will try to use this theory to give a new perspective on the beautiful spatial computations that inspired it. The overall goal of this work is to find a framework where we can talk about complicated non-spatial inference problems with the same precision that is only currently available in space.",Tim Behrens (Oxford),Keynote,2020-03-30 11:00:00+00:00,2020-03-30 12:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/1,main

4,How does the brain cope with continual circuit reconfiguration?,"Over days and weeks, neurons in Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) have been found to continually change their activity patterns during performance of learned sensorimotor tasks, with no obvious change in behavior. This challenges classical theories which assume stable engrams underlie stable behavior (Ganguly 2009, Tonegawa 2015). Recent theoretical work hypothesizes that drift in neural activity may reside in a linear subspace, allowing a stable readout. However, it remains an open question whether experimentally observed drift is compatible with such theory. Using existing data we show that fixed linear weights can approximately decode behavior over many days. However, a non-negligible component of drift occurs outside a linear subspace. We quantify the amount of additional plasticity that would be required to compensate for reconfiguration, and show that accurate readout can be achieved with physiologically achievable rates of synaptic plasticity.",Tim O'Leary (Cambridge),Keynote,2020-03-30 13:00:00+00:00,2020-03-30 14:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/3,main

18,Understanding image memorability,"When asked, ‘Have you seen this image before?’, why are some images easier to remember than others? In this talk, I will review new developments in our understanding of “image memorability” variation, including its behavioral characteristics, its neural correlates, and the optimization principles from which it originates. I will highlight work that has employed large behavioral data to leverage memorability scores computed for individual images. These studies demonstrate that that the mapping of image content to image memorability is predictable, but also non-intuitive and multifaceted. This work has also led to insights into the neural correlates of image memorability, by way of the discovery of a type of population response magnitude variation that emerges in high-level visual cortex as well as higher stages of deep neural networks trained to categorize objects. Finally, in the spirit of neuromatch.io, I will end the talk by describing open questions about image memorability that can be tractably addressed through a combination of existing pretrained deep neural networks and publicly available behavioral and neural data.",Nicole Rust (UPenn),Keynote,2020-03-30 15:00:00+00:00,2020-03-30 16:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/5,main
19,N_neurons -> infinity,"We used 2-photon calcium imaging to record the responses of >10,000 neurons in the visual cortex of awake mice, to thousands of natural images. This dataset was large enough to allow us to consider a limit where the number of recorded neurons and stimuli tends to infinity: by considering neurons and stimuli to have been randomly sampled from a probability distribution, we are able infer the geometry of the full population code, to the full distribution of stimuli. This population code was high-dimensional, with the variance of its dimensions following a n^(-alpha) power law with alpha ~ 1. This power law did not reflect the statistics of natural images, as it persisted even when presenting spatially whitened stimuli. A mathematical analysis showed that a continuous representation of sensory stimuli requires variances decaying faster than n^(-1), and a differentiable representation of a d-dimensional stimulus requires variances decaying faster than n^(-1 -2/d). By recording responses to stimulus ensembles of varying dimension, we showed this bound is saturated. We conclude that the manifold of neural population responses is as high-dimensional as possible before becoming non-differentiable.",Ken Harris (UCL),Keynote,2020-03-30 16:00:00+00:00,2020-03-30 17:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/6,main

38,Envisioning an equitable future for neuroscience,"In recent years, science has been pushed to grapple with the social and structural systems that produce vast gender and racial imbalances in academic participation. While current discussions largely focus on the role of people in positions of power (e.g., journal editors, grant reviewers and agencies, department chairs, and society presidents), many imbalances are in fact caused and perpetuated by researchers themselves. A key example is imbalance within citation practices, where people from marginalized groups are broadly undercited. Because of the downstream effects that citations can have on visibility and career advancement, understanding and eliminating bias in citation practices is vital for addressing inequity in our scientific community. Here we uncover evidence of striking (and growing) gender imbalance in neuroscience reference lists, and offer practical (and open-access) tools for the mitigation of disparity, thereby placing the power for social justice within the hands of individual researchers.",Danielle Bassett (UPenn),Keynote,2020-03-30 19:00:00+00:00,2020-03-30 20:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/9,main

51,Reliability-weighted cue integration in the rodent head direction system,"Studies in rodents have uncovered a system of spatially sensitive neurons that cooperate to form a representation of location, heading direction and speed of movement through the environment. Central to this representation is the head direction system, which combines static environmental information with dynamic self-motion information to generate a head direction signal. This talk will explore recent findings from our lab suggesting that retrosplenial cortex may be the site where weighted directional cue integration occurs, and will propose a mechanism for this weighting process.",Kate Jeffery (UCL),Keynote,2020-03-31 01:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 02:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/11,main
52,Striatal function and its role in goal directed action: a (learning) update,"One of the most intriguing characteristics of the striatum is the random spatial distribution and high degree of intermingling between its D1-(direct) and D2-(indirect) spiny projection neurons (SPNs). The anatomical organisation of these two principal neuronal populations is actively promoted during development and has been highly conserved throughout evolution for over 500 million years, and yet its relationship to function is still not fully understood. In our recent study, by mapping a dopamine-dependent transcriptional activation marker in large ensembles of D1- or D2-SPNs in mice, we demonstrated an extensive and dynamic D2- to D1-SPN transmodulation across the striatum that is necessary for updating previous goal-directed learning.",Miriam Matamales (U New South Wales) - eLife ECR,Keynote,2020-03-31 08:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 09:00:00+00:00,https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_kjbxqvE7RjuMpKGbVhkwkQ,main
53,Perception and encoding of temporally fluctuating odour stimulus in mice,"The field of olfaction has largely been dominated by the notion of being a temporally slow sense and hence temporal structure in odour had not been accounted for a long time. Here, we show that mice can understand correlation in temporal patterns in odour stimulus at frequencies > 40Hz. Further, we observe neurons in the olfactory bulb that can follow frequency upto 20 Hz suggesting the presence of vital neuronal machinery to use naturally occurring temporal patterns in odour stimulus.",Debanjan Dasgupta (Francis Crick Institute) - eLife ECR,Keynote,2020-03-31 08:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 09:00:00+00:00,https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_kjbxqvE7RjuMpKGbVhkwkQ,main
54,It's a matter of nonlinear dendrites,"Our recent modelling predictions, where we challenge the hypothesis that interneurons act simply as linear, widespread inhibitory, blankets across neuronal circuits. Along with supporting experimental evidence that I would briefly highlight, we demonstrate that a major interneuron subtype in CA3 and mPFC - the Fast Spiking Basket cells- contain two types of nonlinear dendrites that support learning and memory functions and are better described by a nonlinear Artificial Neural Network similar to pyramidal neurons. The below proposition raises questions for further studies in order to understand whether interneurons are assistants of leaders in memory formation.",Alexandra Tzilivaki (Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin) - eLife ECR,Keynote,2020-03-31 08:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 09:00:00+00:00,https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_kjbxqvE7RjuMpKGbVhkwkQ,main
55,Illuminating dendritic function using computational modeling,"In this presentation I will discuss research form our lab whereby computational models -supported by experiments- are used to provide new insights on how dendrites contribute to various brain functions. Specifically, I will present our findings on how dendritic nonlinearities in fast spiking interneurons and their can influence the processing abilities of these cells and the encoding of new memories, the role of human dendrites in enabling complex computations such as solving the XOR problem and the contributions of dendrite-targeting interneurons on place cell dynamics in the hippocampus, in health and disease.",Yiota Poirazi (IMBB/FORTH),Keynote,2020-03-31 11:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 12:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/16,main

76,Neuronal circuits for making sense of sounds,"Hearing perception relies on our ability to tell apart the spectral content of different sounds, and to learn to use this difference to distinguish behaviorally relevant (such as dangerous and safe) sounds. However, the neuronal circuits that underlie this modulation remain unknown. In the auditory cortex, the excitatory neurons serve the dominant function in transmitting information about the sensory world within and across brain areas, whereas inhibitory interneurons carry a range of modulatory functions, shaping the way information is represented and processed. I will discuss the results of our recent studies that elucidate the function of neuronal populations in sound encoding and perception. First, we found that the most common class of inhibitory neurons modulate frequency selectivity of excitatory neurons in the auditory cortex and regulate frequency discrimination acuity and specificity of discriminative auditory associative learning. Our results demonstrate that cortical inhibition can improve or impair acuity of innate and learned auditory behaviors. Second, we found that another class of inhibitory neurons regulate adaptation in the auditory cortex to frequent sounds, in a stimulus-specific fashion. By selectively reducing responses to frequently, but not rarely, occurring sounds, auditory cortical neurons enhance the brain's ability to detect unexpected events through stimulus-specific adaptation. The role of these inhibitory neurons extends to other forms of adaptation to temporal regularities. Third, I will discuss a study that reveals a novel function for neuronal responses in the auditory cortex in learning. We found that the activity of cortical neurons predicts the specificity of auditory learning. These results expand our understanding of how specific cortical circuits contribute to auditory perception in everyday acoustic environments.",Maria N.

98,Towards deep learning implementations of functions associated with conscious processing,"Empirical evidence suggests strong links between human intelligence and consciousness, especially with particular abilities humans enjoy with current AI does not. We therefore propose that the next generation of AI will require tackling the non-trivial challenge of endowing machines with some of the functions associated with consciousness. At the same time, a better understanding of the functions associated with consciousness would provide extremely important insights into the human mind. Despite rapid progress, current AI methodologies face considerable limitations, most notably failures of “out-of-distribution robustness”. Fortuitously, recent advances in deep learning allow us to integrate emerging knowledge about consciousness and its functions into AI systems. These initial advances involve formalized but simplistic mechanisms for differentiable attention, memory, modularization of computation and indirect referents to pieces of information. Past progress in deep learning has concentrated mostly on learning from a static dataset, mostly for perception tasks and other System 1 abilities. We argue that towards this objective, soft attention mechanisms constitute a key ingredient to focus computation on a few concepts at a time (a ""conscious thought"") as per the consciousness prior and its associated assumption that many high-level dependencies can be approximately captured by a sparse factor graph. We also argue how the agent perspective in deep learning can help put more constraints on the learned representations to capture affordances, causal variables, and model transitions in the environment. Finally, we propose that meta-learning, the modularization aspect of the consciousness prior and the agent perspective on representation learning should facilitate re-use of learned components in novel ways (even if statistically improbable, as in counterfactuals), enabling more powerful forms of compositional generalization, i.e., out-of-distribution generalization based on the hypothesis of localized (in time, space, and concept space) changes in the environment due to interventions of agents.",Yoshua Bengio (Mila),Keynote,2020-03-31 17:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 18:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/22,main
99,Simultaneous rigidity and flexibility through modularity in cognitive maps for navigation,"Generalizably solving complex problems involves decomposing them into simpler components and combining these parts in effective ways to solve new instances. The hippocampal complex has been a rich playground for understanding how the brain constructs and combines modular structures for flexible computation. This is because the hippocampus and associated areas generate strikingly explicit emergent representations of abstract (latent) low-dimensional variables in the domain of spatial navigation that form the elements of spatial inference but are not directly specified by the world. I will describe recent progress in characterizing the rigid nature of these representations through unsupervised discovery of latent low-dimensional structure from population data and show how these rigid and simple low-dimensional circuits can generate, in a highly flexible way, representations and memory of different (spatial and non-spatial) variables, as seen in recent experiments. I will conclude with an overview of how understanding these circuits in the realm of navigation gives insights into their potential use in higher-dimensional non-spatial cognitive representations as well.",Ila Fiete (MIT),Keynote,2020-03-31 18:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 19:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/23,main

115,Are normative models a good framework for systems neuroscience?,"In recent years there has been increasing interest in the use of top-down, normative models of neural circuits. For example, some researchers have argued that the principles of optimization provided by deep learning should be used as a framework for systems neuroscience. Yet, there are others who question the utility of such normative models, especially in light of ongoing debates regarding how brain functions are operationally defined. In this session, Blake Richards (McGill University/Mila) and Paul Cisek (Université de Montréal) will debate whether normative models provide a good framework for systems neuroscience at this point in the field's development. Blake will argue for ""yes"", Paul for ""no"". Each researcher will present their perspective in 10 minutes, then have a 20 minute debate with each other before opening the session up to audience questions and comments.

116,Not only creating but also understanding deep and recurrent network models of the brain,"Modern machine learning methods have yielded powerful tools to generate network models of diverse brain circuits spanning sensation, cognition and action. However, such models raise profound questions about the very nature of explanation in systems neuroscience. Are we simply replacing something we don’t understand (the brain) with something else we don’t understand (a large deep/recurrent neural network).  Moreover, how do we leverage such models to extract new conceptual hypotheses regarding brain function that can drive the design of the next generation of neuroscience experiments.  We will explore these issues in the context of deep feedforward models of the first steps of vision in the retina, and recurrent neural network models of the entorhinal cortex, obtaining analytic and computational methods to extract a human interpretable conceptual understanding of their development and function.",Surya Ganguli (Stanford),Keynote,2020-03-31 21:00:00+00:00,2020-03-31 22:00:00+00:00,https://www.crowdcast.io/e/neuromatch/26,main
