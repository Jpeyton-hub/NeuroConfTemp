title: "Other markdown page"
slug: "/instructions/other-markdown"
---

This page is rendered from Markdown file located in `sitedata` folder. You can edit information in the
markdown file and slug to control the link to this page. Then you can control
the navigation bar in `src/components/layout.js`. You can use markdown syntax as you use in the
regular markdown such as `code`, **Bold Face**, or _Italic_. In NMC box, we add underline to the
italic for highlighting purpose.
