We are bringing the Neuromatch community together by encouraging participants to form meetups: physical (or virtual/hybrid) groups that gather to watch and participate in the conference together. Think “watch party”, but for science.

Any participant can volunteer to be a local host, and they themselves decide the meetup size and the facilities they provide. Note that the virtual infrastructure will remain the backbone of Neuromatch: participants can still join from their own kitchen/office/hammock.

## Some advantages

- Massively reduced CO2 emissions, since most travel will be local (train/car/public transport)
- Shorter/local travel makes it easier for people with travel restrictions (e.g. those with small children and other caregivers) to still attend in-person
- Build local communities
- In-person meetups may help increase engagement and reduce Zoom fatigue. They also can make it easier to carry the conference forward: before/after/during, local attendees can gather over food/drinks and continue the discussion.
- Since the core of the meeting is still virtual, meetups can immediately be canceled or scaled-down, if the local COVID situation and health regulations change.

## Host sign-ups

You can volunteer to be a host by providing detailed location, institution, capacity, and code of conduct (including security and health information). Neuromatch will approve each host, which should take a few days. Then we will list the meetup, allowing attendees to apply to join. The information for the meeting can be edited later, e.g. if your local COVID situation demands changes.

## Attendees sign-ups

Neuromatch conference 4 allows you to join a meetup near you. You can find all the listings of meetups and descriptions below. You fill out the form and click join if you are interested to join the local meetup. After that, you can wait for the host to accept (or reject). Note that the host may reject for multiple reasons such as full space, change in local COVID policy among others.

**Note**
Neuromatch Conference meetups are encouraged and recommended to improve community involvement and experience with the conference, but ultimately are organized and hosted by the community. You are responsible for deciding whether to take part in a local meetup as a host or participant, including your own assessment of the host and the location’s safety and suitability. Neuromatch does not organize meetups, and cannot be held liable for activities or consequences of local meetups; this includes health and safety consequences (e.g., Neuromatch cannot be held liable if your local meetup results in a COVID exposure). If you have concerns about a meetup host or location, either before the conference or afterwards, please provide details of your concerns via email to `nmc@neuromatch.io`.
