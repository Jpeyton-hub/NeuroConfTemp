Neuromatch 4.0 welcomes abstracts in any topic area within computational neuroscience! Please register and submit your abstract under your profile (the submission is opening soon). Submission deadline is on October 25, 2021.

### Abstract Selection

Abstracts will be screened only for obvious topical irrelevance to the computational neuroscience community. Our program committee will select **traditional talk presentation** from the submitted abstracts and all other presentations will be **recorded flash talk (poster)**. All abstracts will be considered for talks, but if selected you will have the opportunity to accept or switch to a flash talk.

### Talks

There are two types of talk at NMC4: Traditional talks and Flash talks.

#### Traditional Talks

Traditional talks will be scheduled for a single _15 minute time slot_, consisting of a _12 minute presentation_ and _3 minutes of Q&A_. Speakers are expected to show up 10 minutes before their session starts and attend the full session to allow for great discussions.

#### Flash talks

Flash talks will be a _5 minute pre-recorded "flash talk"_ featuring a dedicated channel on our Discord server for attendees to follow the conversation. This format is meant to allow discussions during and after the conference. Speakers are responsible for uploading slides (optional) and URL link to the recording on Youtube after the acceptance. Please make sure you set the Youtube link to `unlisted` or `public` so we can see it prior to the launch of the schedule; if you don’t, your talk may be pulled from the program.

### Preprint linking

You can provide a link to your preprints (posted on any preprint server bioRxiv, arXiv, PsyArxiv,etc) or journal article(s) that are related to your conference abstract/talk. We are developing new mechanisms to connect talks in the conference to corresponding preprints on bioRxiv, and we will provide links to papers on other platforms as well. If your preprint comes out after you submit, send us an email about it.

**Note ·** We only allow one submission per attendee. An additional submission will replace the former one.<br>**Further questions ·** If you have further questions, please email `nmc@neuromatch.io`.
