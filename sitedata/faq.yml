- question: Will these abstracts be published in any kind of journal?
  answer: "Unfortunately that's not something we are able to do at this point, though\
    \ we are always looking for ways to innovate.  \n"
  tag: submission
- answer: This will be around 3 days after the submissions (tentatively October 5,
    2020). We will put your schedule on our site (TBD) for you to check. We will allow
    you to swap your presentation time slot if it does not work best for you.
  question: When will I know my schedule after I submit my abstract?
  tag: submission
- answer: "If you think some references are absolutely crucial you may include them,\
    \ but try to avoid using them in general. The submission portal will not block\
    \ you from submitting more than 300 words, so the references will not count against\
    \ that limit.  \n"
  question: Can I include references in my abstract and will they count against the
    suggested word limit?
  tag: submission
- answer: "We will review abstracts only to the extent of verifying that they are\
    \ scientific in some sense (i.e. not advertisements or otherwise off-target contributions)\
    \ but there is no peer review in the traditional sense, or filtering for novelty/importance,\
    \ etc. \n"
  question: I heard that all talks are accepted, does this mean there is no review?
  tag: submission
- question: Will I receive an email confirmation that I have submitted an abstract?
  answer: 'We do not send an email confirmation, but you can just log back in and
    view your abstract to make sure it was submitted. You can edit the submission
    up until the submission deadline elapses.'
