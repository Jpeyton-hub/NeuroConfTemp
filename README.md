# Neuromatch in a box

Without technology backbone, making a conference is probably hard for many organizers.
In 2020, we built [Neuromatch conferences](https://neuromatch.io/conference/)
which allow organizers to automate many aspects of the conference. Here, we try to
open-source multiple aspects for other organizers.

## Components

* Registration
* Recommendation engine
* Mind matching (run separately to produce output)
* Schedule optimization (TBA)

## Structure

* Frontend using ReactJS
* Backend using Python
